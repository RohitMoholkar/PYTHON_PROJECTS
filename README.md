## In this repository, I have included Python projects as well as graphical user interface (GUI) projects developed using Python.  

### Project1 Description. 
- Project Name: **ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING PYTHON.** 
- The "ATM Management System using Python" project simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) through a text-based interface.
- Users can perform several banking operations, including checking their account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.
- For loops, While loop, if-else conditions, and user-defined functions have all been heavily utilized in this project. 
- Run the script, and the program will display a welcome message and prompt the user for their ID and password.
- User Interface is Command-line interface (CLI) for simplicity and ease of use.
- User Authentication: Users are required to enter a valid ID and password to access their accounts. If the provided credentials match the predefined values, the user is granted access; otherwise, they are denied access.
- Account Balance: Users can check their account balance, which is initially set to 500000.
- Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts by specifying the amount they want to deposit.
- Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient funds.
- Menu System: The program offers a menu-driven system for users to select the desired operation, including returning to the main menu or exiting the program. 
- Users can return to the main menu or exit the program. 
- This project sserves as a practical exercise for Python programming and software development concepts while exploring the principles of ATM operations and management.
