## In this repository, I have included Python projects as well as graphical user interface (GUI) projects developed using Python.  

### Project1 Description. 
- Project Name: **ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING PYTHON.** 
- The "ATM Management System using Python" project simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) through a text-based interface.
- Users can perform several banking operations, including checking their account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.
- For loops, While loop, if-else conditions, and user-defined functions have all been heavily utilized in this project. 
- Run the script, and the program will display a welcome message and prompt the user for their ID and password.
- User Interface is Command-line interface (CLI) for simplicity and ease of use.
- User Authentication: Users are required to enter a valid ID and password to access their accounts. If the provided credentials match the predefined values, the user is granted access; otherwise, they are denied access.
- Account Balance: Users can check their account balance, which is initially set to 500000.
- Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts by specifying the amount they want to deposit.
- Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient funds.
- Menu System: The program offers a menu-driven system for users to select the desired operation, including returning to the main menu or exiting the program. 
- Users can return to the main menu or exit the program. 
- This project sserves as a practical exercise for Python programming and software development concepts while exploring the principles of ATM operations and management. 

### About Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
The GUI, or graphical user interface, is a type of user interface that can be used on desktop computers, or mobile phones to represent the actions and operations of the user. These applications can receive inputs through mouse clicks and can enable the user to choose from alternatives with the help of radio buttons, dropdown lists, and other GUI elements (or widgets). For the GUI, Python UI libraries can be used. Everyone is probably know that Tkinter is among the best and most widely used Python GUI library. 

### About Python Tkinter Library:

A collection of tools called Tkinter, which allows Python to be used to render graphical user interfaces. Tkinter is the Python port for Tcl-Tk GUI toolkit developed by Fredrik Lundh. It enables the GUI-based execution of Python scripts. Initially, import the TKinter module. After importing, use the Tk() function to set up the application object. This will create a basic window also known as root, a frame will display title bar, control box with the minimize and close buttons, and some space to hold other widgets. All Tkinter widget classes are inherited from the Widget class. Using these classes you can create perfect GUI. 

### Project2 Description. 
- The project, titled TIMEFRAME GUI: PYTHON-BASED DIGITAL CLOCK AND DATE DISPLAY, is implemented in Python.
- It leverages the tkinter and time Python libraries for GUI creation and time/date retrieval, respectively.
- The tkinter library serves the purpose of crafting the graphical user interface, while the time module facilitates the retrieval of current time and date information.
- The project centers around a "Digital_Clock" class, designed to manage various GUI functions. Each function within the class is dedicated to constructing specific graphical elements (widgets), initializing the GUI window, setting up clock and date display frames, and continuously updating time and date information.
- Upon executing the script, a GUI window promptly appears on the screen.
- Digital Clock Display: The application showcases a real-time digital clock, presenting the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format (e.g., 01:45:00 PM).
- Date Display: The GUI also exhibits the current date, including the month, day, and year (e.g., 10/25/2023).
- GUI Layout: The graphical user interface is divided into two distinct sections. The upper section displays the digital clock, while the lower section exhibits the date. Each component is contained within separate frames, distinguished by unique background colors for enhanced visual clarity.
- Overall, the project provides valuable hands-on experience in GUI development, class-based programming paradigms, and real-time data presentation techniques.
  
### Project3 Description. 
- Project Name: **DIGITAL CALCULATOR WITH GUI USING PYTHON.**
- Implementation Language: Python.
- Description: The "Digital Calculator with GUI using Python" project is a graphical calculator application created using the Tkinter library. It offers a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations.
- Project Structure: The project utilizes several classes and functions to create the calculator's graphical user interface and perform arithmetic calculations. The main class, "Calculator," serves as the central controller for the application.
- Functionality: Functions include Initialization (init), Button Functions (number, operator, equal, clear, square, sqrt), Button Widgets (num_buttons, operator_buttons, equaltoo_button, clear_button, square_button, sqrt_button), Event Handling (bind_keys), Label Update Functions (update_frame1, update_frame2), and Close Function (close).
- Execution: Running the script opens a GUI window for the calculator, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations.
- User Interface: The calculator features buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, clear functions, and special operations like square and square root.
- Basic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the calculator.
- Special Operations: The calculator offers functionalities such as squaring a number (x²) and finding the square root (√x).
- Input Methods: Users can input digits and operators using the mouse or keyboard. Pressing "Enter" calculates the result.
- Real-time Display: The calculator displays entered numbers and operations in real-time on the screen.
- Error Handling: The calculator gracefully handles certain errors, displaying "Error" when an invalid expression is entered.
- This project caters to a broad audience, including students, professionals, and anyone in need of a user-friendly digital calculator tool.
